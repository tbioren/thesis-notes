## Plan for Meeting with Eduardo

### Discuss Nextpnr

1. Nextpnr will do something called "permutation" where it will flip the inputs of a LUT and change its init value to make the behavior the same. This isn't inherently an issue as long as it's the same every time.
2. Show powerpoint (I also verified all the stuff in the (1, 1) cell.)
3. Discuss if it's worth going into nextpnr and seeing if I can remove permutation.

### Discuss Simulation

1. I tried to figure out how to run a simulation of the bitstream and unfortunately it looks like it's not feasible. You can use Icarus Verilog to run a Verilog outputted from Yosys but it's not necessarily the same as the asc that's outputted by nextpnr.
2. I think it's probably a good idea to modify the EHW upload script and score that way.
