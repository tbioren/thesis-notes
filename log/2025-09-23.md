## Meeting with Eduardo

- Discussed hardware progress
	- I talked about how I "killed 2 birds with 1 stone" by looking into the Pico Ice bitstream upload process for both EHW and thesis.
	- I want to put hardware on the back burner for now because I think it's important to get an MVP simulated evolution process done.
	- Only work on hardware in EHW for now.
- **Goal for next meeting:** read and grade [[Evolutionary Design of Digital Circuits Using Genetic Programming.pdf]].
	- Read and understand for thesis.
	- Grade for research lab.
- **Goal for 2 weeks from now:** High-level representation of the graph structure and mutation process including what goes on inside the nodes.
- We're cancelling our Thursday meetings in favor of longer Tuesday meetings.
