**Simulation Design**

Every node in the graph represents a LUT. It has up to 4 inputs and 1 output. The 1 output can go to multiple other nodes' inputs.

Eventually, I want to switch to nodes representing tiles and having subgraphs for the LUTs.

For the time being, I am going to generate HDL and describe the LUTs there. Then, I'm going to go to
