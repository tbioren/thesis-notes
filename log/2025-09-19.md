## EHW Config

- I'm setting up the EHW config on a Multipass VM on my MacBook. I'm just doing a proof of concept then I'll move it to the Pi once I get it working.
- I seemed to get the VM working as well as it will without any hardware, so now I'm moving it to my Pi.
- I need an ethernet cable to use the Pi because it won't connect to my WiFi. I'll get that on the way back from school today.
