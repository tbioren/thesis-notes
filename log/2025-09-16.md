- Modified the burnup chart so it's embedded in this work log note instead of in a separate Excel sheet.
- I read the slides and watched the accompanying YouTube video for [[Julian Miller - Tutorial CGP]].
- I decided to focus on designing the experiment for a [[Pico-Ice]] FPGA board because it's similar to EHW and hopefully will be easy to cross-reference bitstream performance in the future.
- It looks like the FPGA is supported by [[Project IceStorm]], so it should be plug and play for EHW.
