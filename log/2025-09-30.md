I am trying to figure out how the logic tiles connect to each other. I need to make sure I can get the routing perfect before I generate the CGP stuff.

I got the icebox DB finally to show up! I will read through this.

It looks like nextpnr takes JSON configs. This is probably how I'm going to get it to make bitstreams.

**Steps**

- Install Project IceStorm tools (yosys, nextpnr, icebox)
- [https://prjicestorm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#where-are-the-tools-how-to-install]. Important: follow the nextpnr steps instead of icestorm for its install.

- I want to get a JSON out of this.

Yosys JSON: [[general-knowledge/resources/rgb.json]]


ChatGPT says I need to make a JSON from the genotype to give it to nextpnr.
