I met with the EHW group and Brooklyn told me about some tools such as [APIO](https://fpgawars.github.io/apio/quick-start/#step-4-simulating-the-design) and PicoTool that apparently will upload bitstreams for you.

I want to use APIO to upload bitstreams to the FPGA because it packages everything together in one tool.
