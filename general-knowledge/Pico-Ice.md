## Notes

- [[Project IceStorm]] claims they can program its FPGA (ICE40UP5K).
- New features compared to old iCE40
	- Internal DSP units, capable of 16-bit multiply and 32-bit accumulate.
	- 1Mbit of extra single-ported RAM, in addition to the usual BRAM
	- Internal hard IP cores for I2C and SPI
	- 2 internal oscillators, 48MHz (with divider) and 10kHz
	- 24mA constant current LED ouputs and PWM hard IP

## DSP Tiles

- Similar to logic tiles but have DSP stuff instead of LUTs
- I think I should avoid this because it feels like cheating
